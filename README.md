## Problem
- A study done by a team of specialists on cognitive neuroscience and psychology to survey the general public in China to understand their their levels of psychological impact during the COVID-19 outbreak. Among 1210 respondents, 53.8% of rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe where, 16.5% reported depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. The journal also reported that one of the factors associated with these adverse mental outcomes was social isolation due to quarantine. (Wang, C et al., Immediate Psychological Responses and Associated Factors during the Initial Stage of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Epidemic among the General Population in China. 2020). Another journal has also suggested that misinformation may adversely effect mental health by causing confusion among the general public, hence causing panic and distress (Samia et al., Impact of rumors or misinformation on coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in social media. 2020). The CDC has also identified a group of individuals who may respond more strongly to the stress of this crisis, including older people, those with underlying medical comorbidities, childrens and adoloscents, front-liners and those with preexisting mental conditions.
    
- A study to assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes among healthcare workers treating patients with Covid-19 showed that among 1257 respondents consisting of doctors, nurses and emergency responders, 50.4% of them reported depressive symptoms, 44.6% reported anxiety symptoms and 71.5% reported distress, with nurses and frontline workers being those with most severe symptoms. (Jianbo Lai et al., Factors Associated with Mental Health Outcomes Among Health Care Workers Exposed to Coronavirus Disease 2019, 2020).
